;;; A PAGE is basically a single markdown or html file to where the
;;; documentation of some references is written. See the DOCUMENT
;;; function.
;;;
;;; Documentation starts out being sent to a certain stream, but the
;;; output is redirected to different stream if it is for a reference
;;; on the current page (see REACHABLE-CANONICAL-REFERENCES,
;;; PAGE-REFERENCES). This stream - to which the temporary markdown
;;; output written - is given by PAGE-TEMP-STREAM-SPEC, that's a
;;; stream spec (see WITH-OPEN-STREAM-SPEC) to allow the temporary
;;; stream to
;;;
;;; - be created lazily so that no stray files are left around and
;;;   only a small number of fds are needed even for a huge project;
;;;
;;; - be opened multiple times (which is not a given for string
;;;   streams).
;;;
;;; So, output is written in markdown format to PAGE-TEMP-STREAM-SPEC,
;;; but before we are done, it is converted to the requested output
;;; format, and HEADER-FN, FOOTER-FN are called to write arbitrary
;;; leading and trailing content to the final stream.
;;;
;;; Finally, URI-FRAGMENT is a string such as "doc/manual.html" that
;;; specifies where the page will be deployed on a webserver. It
;;; defines how links between pages will look. If it's not specified
;;; and OUTPUT refers to a file, then it defaults to the name of the
;;; file. If URI-FRAGMENT is NIL, then no links will be made to or
;;; from that page.

  FORMAT can be anything [3BMD][3bmd] supports, which is currently
  :MARKDOWN, :HTML and :PLAIN. STREAM may be a [STREAM][type] object,
  T or NIL as with CL:FORMAT.

  Most often, this function is called on SECTION objects as in
  `(DOCUMENT @PAX-MANUAL)`, but it supports all kinds of objects for
  which DOCUMENT-OBJECT is defined. To look up the documentation of
  the DOCUMENT function itself:

      (document #'document)

  The same with fancy markup:

      (document #'document :format :markdown)

  To generate the documentation for separate libraries with automatic
  cross-links:

      (document (list @cube-manual @mat-manual) :format :markdown)

  See @DOCUMENTATION-UTILITIES for more.

  Note that not only first-class objects can have documentation:

      (document (locate 'foo 'type))

  See @LOCATIVES-AND-REFERENCES for more.

  There are quite a few special variables that affect how output is
  generated, see @CODIFICATION, @LINKING-TO-CODE,
  @LINKING-TO-SECTIONS, and
  @MISCELLANEOUS-DOCUMENTATION-PRINTER-VARIABLES.

  If PAGES is NIL and STREAM is NIL, then DOCUMENT returns the output
  as a string. If PAGES is NIL but STREAM is not, then DOCUMENT
  returns NIL. The rest of this description deals with how to generate
  multiple pages.

  ##### Pages

  [page-specs-to-pages function][docstring]

  ##### Packages

  While generating the documentation, symbols may be read (e.g. from
  docstrings) or printed according, which is affected by the values of
  *PACKAGE* and *READTABLE*. See *DOCUMENT-NORMALIZE-PACKAGES* for the
  details.

;;;; Page specs

;;; Convert the PAGES argument of DOCUMENT to PAGE objects.
(defun page-specs-to-pages (page-specs documentable stream)
  """The PAGES argument is to create multi-page documents by routing
  some of the generated output to files, strings or streams. PAGES is
  a list of page specification elements. A page spec is a [property
  list][clhs] with keys :OBJECTS, :OUTPUT, :URI-FRAGMENT,
  :SOURCE-URI-FN, :HEADER-FN and :FOOTER-FN. OBJECTS is a list of
  objects (references are allowed but not required) whose
  documentation is to be sent to :OUTPUT.

  When documentation for an object is generated, the first matching
  page spec is used, where the object matches the page spec if it is
  [reachable][COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS generic-function] from one of
  its :OBJECTS.

  :OUTPUT can be a number things:

  - If it's a list whose first element is a string or a pathname, then
    output will be sent to the file denoted by that and the rest of
    the elements of the list are passed on to CL:OPEN. One extra
    keyword argument is :ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST. If it's true,
    ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST will be called on the pathname before
    it's opened.

  - If it's NIL, then output will be collected in a string.

  - If it's T, then output will be sent to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.

  - If it's a stream, then output will be sent to that stream.

  If some pages are specified, DOCUMENT returns a list of designators
  for generated output. If a page whose :OUTPUT refers to a file that
  was created (which doesn't happen if nothing would be written to
  it), then the corresponding pathname is included in the list. For
  strings the string itself, while for streams the stream object is
  included in the list. This way it's possible to write some pages to
  files and some to strings and have the return value indicate what
  was created. The output designators in the returned list are ordered
  by creation time.

  Note that even if PAGES is specified, STREAM acts as a catch all,
  taking the generated documentation for references not claimed by any
  pages. Also, the filename, string or stream corresponding to STREAM
  is always the first element in the list of generated things, that is
  the return value.

  :HEADER-FN, if not NIL, is a function of a single stream argument,
  which is called just before the first write to the page. Since
  :FORMAT :HTML only generates HTML fragments, this makes it possible
  to print arbitrary headers, typically setting the title, CSS
  stylesheet, or charset.

  :FOOTER-FN is similar to :HEADER-FN, but it's called after the last
  write to the page. For HTML, it typically just closes the body.

  :URI-FRAGMENT is a string such as `"doc/manual.html"` that specifies
  where the page will be deployed on a webserver. It defines how links
  between pages will look. If it's not specified and :OUTPUT refers to
  a file, then it defaults to the name of the file. If :URI-FRAGMENT
  is NIL, then no links will be made to or from that page.

  Finally, :SOURCE-URI-FN is a function of a single, REFERENCE
  argument. If it returns a value other than NIL, then it must be a
  string representing an \URI. If FORMAT is :HTML and
  *DOCUMENT-MARK-UP-SIGNATURES* is true, then the locative as
  displayed in the signature will be a link to this URI. See
  MAKE-GIT-SOURCE-URI-FN.

  PAGES may look something like this:

  ```
  `((;; The section about SECTIONs and everything below it ...
     :objects (, @sections)
     ;; ... is so boring that it's not worth the disk space, so
     ;; send it to a string.
     :output (nil)
     ;; Explicitly tell other pages not to link to these guys.
     :uri-fragment nil)
    ;; Send the @EXTENSION-API section and everything reachable
    ;; from it ...
    (:objects (, @extension-api)
     ;; ... to build/tmp/pax-extension-api.html.
     :output ("build/tmp/pax-extension-api.html")
     ;; However, on the web server html files will be at this
     ;; location relative to some common root, so override the
     ;; default:
     :uri-fragment "doc/dev/pax-extension-api.html"
     ;; Set html page title, stylesheet, charset.
     :header-fn 'write-html-header
     ;; Just close the body.
     :footer-fn 'write-html-footer)
    ;; Catch the reference that were not reachable from the above. It
    ;; is important for this page spec to be last.

(defsection @local-references (:title "Local References")
  """To declutter the generated output by reducing the number of
  links, the so-called local references (e.g. references to the very
  definition for which documentation is being generated) are treated
  specially. In the following example, there are local references to
  the function FOO and its arguments, so none of them get turned into
  links:

  ```
  (defun foo (arg1 arg2)
    "FOO takes two arguments: ARG1 and ARG2."
    t)
  ```

  If linking was desired, one could use a @SPECIFIED-LOCATIVE (e.g.
  `[FOO][function]` or `FOO function`), which results in a single
  link. An explicit link with an unspecified locative like `[FOO][]`
  generates links to all references involving the `FOO` symbol except
  the local ones.

  The exact rules for local references are as follows:

  - [linkables-for-autolink-with-unspecified-locative function][docstring]

  - [linkables-for-specified-locative function][docstring]

  - [linkables-for-explicitly-unspecified-locative function][docstring]

  """A list of versions of PAX \URL formats to support in the
  generated documentation. The first in the list is used to generate
  links.

  PAX emits HTML anchors before the documentation of SECTIONs
  (see @LINKING-TO-SECTIONS) and other things (see @LINKING-TO-CODE).
  For the function `FOO`, in the current version (version 2), the
  anchor is `<a id="MGL-PAX:FOO%20FUNCTION">` and its \URL will end
  with `\\#MGL-PAX:FOO%20FUNCTION`.

  _Note that to make the \URL independent of whether a symbol is
  [internal or external][find-symbol] to their SYMBOL-PACKAGE, single
  colon is printed where a double colon would be expected. Package and
  symbol names are both printed verbatim except for escaping colons
  and spaces with a backslash. For exported symbols with no funny
  characters, this coincides with how PRIN1 would print the symbol,
  while having the benefit of making the \URL independent of the Lisp
  printer's escaping strategy and producing human-readable output for
  mixed-case symbols. No such promises are made for non-ASCII
  characters, and their \URLs may change in future versions. Locatives
  are printed with PRIN1._

  Version 1 is based on the more strict HTML4 standard and the id of
  `FOO` is `"x-28MGL-PAX-3A-3AFOO-20FUNCTION-29"`. This is supported
  by Github-flavoured Markdown. Version 2 has minimal clutter and is
  obviously preferred. However, in order not to break external links,
  by default, both anchors are generated.

  Let's understand the generated Markdown.

  ```
  (defun foo (x))

  (document #'foo :format :markdown)
  => ("<a id=\"x-28MGL-PAX-3AFOO-20FUNCTION-29\"></a>

  [downcasing][\*document-downcase-uppercase-code*], and
  @LINKING-TO-CODE works.

  - One backslash in front of a @WORD turns codification off. Use this
    to prevent codification words such as \DOCUMENT, which is all
    uppercase hence @CODIFIABLE, and it names an exported symbol hence
    it is @INTERESTING.

  - One backslash right after an opening backtick turns autolinking
    off.

  - Two backslashes right after an opening backtick turns autolinking
    and downcasing off. Use this for things that are not Lisp code but
    which need to be in a monospace font."""
  """In the following examples capital C/D/A letters mark the presence,
  and a/b/c the absence of codification, downcasing, and autolinking
  assuming all these features are enabled by
  *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE*, *DOCUMENT-DOWNCASE-UPPERCASE-CODE*,
  and *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*.

  """Documentation Generation is supported on ABCL, AllegroCL, CLISP,
  \CCL, CMUCL, ECL and SBCL, but their outputs may differ due to the
  lack of some introspective capability. SBCL generates complete
  output. Compared to that, the following are not supported:

  - COMPILER-MACRO docstrings on ABCL, AllegroCL, \CCL, ECL;
  - DEFTYPE lambda lists on ABCL, AllegroCL, CLISP, \CCL, CMUCL, ECL;
  - default values in MACRO lambda lists on AllegroCL;
  - METHOD-COMBINATION docstrings on ABCL, AllegroCL.

  In addition, CLISP does not support the ambiguous case of @PAX-URLS
  for @BROWSING-LIVE-DOCUMENTATION because the current implementation
  relies on Swank to list definitions of symbols (as VARIABLE,
  [FUNCTION][locative], etc), and that simply doesn't work.""")
