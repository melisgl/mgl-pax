(defsection @locative-types (:title "Locative Types")
  """As we have already briefly seen in DEFSECTION and
  @LOCATIVES-AND-REFERENCES, locatives allow us to refer to, document,
  and find the source location of various definitions beyond what
  standard Common Lisp offers. See @EXTENSION-API for a more detailed
  treatment. The following are the locatives types supported out of
  the box. As all locative types, they are named by symbols, which
  should make it obvious what kind of things they refer to. Unless
  otherwise noted, locatives take no arguments.

  When there is a corresponding CL type, a locative can be resolved to
  a unique object as is the case in `(LOCATE 'FOO 'CLASS)` returning
  `#<CLASS FOO>`. Even if there is no such CL type, the source
  location and the docstring of the defining form is recorded (see
  LOCATE-AND-FIND-SOURCE, LOCATE-AND-DOCUMENT in the @EXTENSION-API),
  which makes navigating the sources with `\\M-.` (see
  @NAVIGATING-IN-EMACS) and @GENERATING-DOCUMENTATION possible."""

  In the above example, pressing `\\M-.` on `PAX.EL` will open the
  `src/mgl-pax.el` file and put the cursor on its first character.
  `\\M-.` on `FOO-EXAMPLE` will go to the source location of
  the `(asdf:system locative)` locative.

  When documentation is generated, the entire `src/mgl-pax.el` file is
  included in the markdown surrounded by the strings given as
  HEADER-NL and FOOTER-NL (if any). The trailing newline character is
  assumed implicitly. If that's undesirable, then use HEADER and
  FOOTER instead. The documentation of `FOO-EXAMPLE` will be the
  region of the file from the source location of the START
  locative (inclusive) to the source location of the END
  locative (exclusive). START and END default to the beginning and end
  of the file, respectively.

  Note that the file of the source location of :START and :END must be
  the same. If SOURCE is a pathname designator, then it must be
  absolute so that the locative is context independent.

  Finally, if specified, LINE-PREFIX is a string that's prepended to
  each line included in the documentation. For example, a string of
  four spaces makes markdown think it's a code block.

  """Refers to sections or definitions in the Common Lisp Hyperspec.
  These have no source location so `\\M-.` will not work. What works
  is linking in documentation, including @BROWSING-LIVE-DOCUMENTATION.
  The generated links are relative to *DOCUMENT-HYPERSPEC-ROOT* and
  work even if *DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC* is NIL.

  - *definitions*: These are typically unnecessary as DOCUMENT will
    produce the same link for e.g. `\\PPRINT`, `[PPRINT][function]`,
    or `[PPRINT][]` if *DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC* is non-NIL and the
    PPRINT function in the running Lisp is not being DOCUMENTed. When
    @BROWSING-LIVE-DOCUMENTATION, a slight difference is that
    everything is being DOCUMENTed, so using the CLHS link bypasses
    the page with the definition in the running Lisp.

      - *unambiguous*: `[pprint][clhs]` ([pprint][clhs])

      - *ambiguous*: `[function][clhs]` ([function][clhs])

      - *explicit*: `[function][(clhs class)]` ([function][(clhs class)])

  - *glossary terms* (case-insensitive): [lambda list][(clhs glossary-term)]

  - *issues*: `[ISSUE:AREF-1D][clhs]` or `[ISSUE:AREF-1D][(clhs
     section)]` ([ISSUE:AREF-1D][clhs])

  - *issue summaries*: `[SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5][clhs]` or
     `[SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5][(clhs
     section)]` ([SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5][clhs])

  - *sections*:

       - *by section number*: `[3.4][clhs]` or `[3.4][(clhs
          section)]` ([3.4][clhs])

       - *by section title* (case-insensitive, substring match):
          `[lambda lists][clhs]` or `[lambda lists][(clhs
          section)]` ([lambda lists][clhs])

       - *by filename*: `[03_d][clhs]` or `[03_d][(clhs
          section)]` ([03_d][clhs])

  As the above examples show, the NESTED-LOCATIVE argument of the CLHS
  locative may be omitted. In that case, definitions, glossary terms,
  issues, issue summaries, and sections are considered in that order.
  Sections are considered last because a substring of a section title
  can be matched by chance easily.

  All examples so far used [explicit][ @explicit-and-autolinking]
  links. Autolinking also works if the @OBJECT is marked up as code or
  is [codified][ @codification] (e.g. in `PPRINT clhs` (PPRINT clhs).

  As mentioned above, `\M-.` does not do anything over CLHS
  references. Slightly more usefully, the [live documentation
  browser][@browsing-live-documentation] understands CLHS links so one
  can enter inputs like `3.4 clhs`, `"lambda list" clhs` or `error (clhs
  function)`.
