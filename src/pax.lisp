  "As a user, I frequently run into documentation that's incomplete
  and out of date, so I tend to stay in the editor and explore the
  code by jumping around with SLIME's [`M-.`][SLIME-M-.]. As a library
  author, I spend a great deal of time polishing code, but precious
  little writing documentation.

  [SLIME-M-.]: http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Finding-definitions.html#Finding-definitions

  In fact, I rarely write anything more comprehensive than docstrings
  for exported stuff. Writing docstrings feels easier than writing a
  separate user manual and they are always close at hand during
  development. The drawback of this style is that users of the library
  have to piece the big picture together themselves.

  That's easy to solve, I thought, let's just put all the narrative
  that holds docstrings together in the code and be a bit like a
  Literate Programming weenie turned inside out. The original
  prototype which did almost everything I wanted was this:

  ```
  (defmacro defsection (name docstring)
    `(defun ,name () ,docstring))
  ```

  Armed with DEFSECTION, I soon found myself organizing code following
  the flow of user level documentation and relegated comments to
  implementational details entirely. However, some portions of
  DEFSECTION docstrings were just listings of all the functions,
  macros and variables related to the narrative, and this list was
  effectively repeated in the DEFPACKAGE form complete with little
  comments that were like section names. A clear violation of
  [OAOO][oaoo], one of them had to go, so DEFSECTION got a list of
  symbols to export.

  [oaoo]: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OnceAndOnlyOnce
  
  That was great, but soon I found that the listing of symbols is
  ambiguous if, for example, a function, a compiler macro and a class
  are named by the same symbol. This did not concern exporting, of
  course, but it didn't help readability. Distractingly, on such
  symbols, M-. was popping up selection dialogs. There were two birds
  to kill, and the symbol got accompanied by a type which was later
  generalized into the concept of locatives:

  ```
  (defsection @pax-introduction
    \"A single line for one man ...\"
    (foo class)
    (bar function))
  ```

  After a bit of elisp hacking, M-. was smart enough to disambiguate
  based on the locative found in the vicinity of the symbol and
  everything was good for a while.

  Then I realized that sections could refer to other sections if there
  were a SECTION locative. Going down that path, I soon began to feel
  the urge to generate pretty documentation as all the necessary
  information was manifest in the DEFSECTION forms. The design
  constraint imposed on documentation generation was that following
  the typical style of upcasing symbols in docstrings there should be
  no need to explicitly mark up links: if M-. works, then the
  documentation generator shall also be able find out what's being
  referred to.

  I settled on [Markdown][markdown] as a reasonably non-intrusive
  format, and a few thousand lines later PAX was born.

  [markdown]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/")

(defsection @pax-tutorial (:title "Tutorial")
  "PAX provides an extremely poor man's Explorable Programming
  environment. Narrative primarily lives in so called sections that
  mix markdown docstrings with references to functions, variables,
  etc, all of which should probably have their own docstrings.

  The primary focus is on making code easily explorable by using
  SLIME's M-. (`slime-edit-definition`). See how to enable some
  fanciness in @PAX-EMACS-INTEGRATION. Generating documentation from
  sections and all the referenced items in Markdown or HTML format is
  also implemented.

  With the simplistic tools provided, one may accomplish similar
  effects as with Literate Programming, but documentation is generated
  from code, not vice versa and there is no support for chunking yet.
  Code is first, code must look pretty, documentation is code.

  In typical use, PAX packages have no :EXPORT's defined. Instead the
  DEFINE-PACKAGE form gets a docstring which may mention section
  names (defined with DEFSECTION). When the code is loaded into the
  lisp, pressing M-. in SLIME on the name of the section will take you
  there. Sections can also refer to other sections, packages,
  functions, etc and you can keep exploring.

  Here is an example of how it all works together:

  ```
  (mgl-pax:define-package :foo-random
    (:documentation \"This package provides various utilities for
    random. See FOO-RANDOM:@FOO-RANDOM-MANUAL.\")
    (:use #:common-lisp #:mgl-pax))

  (in-package :foo-random)

  (defsection @foo-random-manual (:title \"Foo Random manual\")
    \"Here you describe what's common to all the referenced (and
    exported) functions that follow. They work with *FOO-STATE*,
    and have a :RANDOM-STATE keyword arg. Also explain when to 
    choose which.\"
    (foo-random-state class)
    (state (reader foo-random-state))
    \"Hey we can also print states!\"
    (print-object (method () (foo-random-state t)))
    (*foo-state* variable)
    (gaussian-random function)
    (uniform-random function)
    ;; this is a subsection
    (@foo-random-examples section))

  (defclass foo-random-state ()
    ((state :reader state)))

  (defmethod print-object ((object foo-random-state) stream)
    (print-unreadable-object (object stream :type t)))

  (defvar *foo-state* (make-instance 'foo-random-state)
    \"Much like *RANDOM-STATE* but uses the FOO algorithm.\")

  (defun uniform-random (limit &key (random-state *foo-state*))
    \"Return a random number from the [0, LIMIT) uniform distribution.\"
    nil)

  (defun gaussian-random (stddev &key (random-state *foo-state*))
    \"Return a random number from a zero mean normal distribution with
    STDDEV.\"
    nil)

  (defsection @foo-random-examples (:title \"Examples\"))
  ```

  Generating documentation in a very stripped down markdown format is
  easy:

  ```
  (describe @foo-random-manual)
  ```

  For this example, the generated markdown would look like this:

      # Foo Random manual

      Here you describe what's common to all the referenced (and
      exported) functions that follow. They work with *FOO-STATE*,
      and have :RANDOM-STATE keyword arg. Also explain when to choose
      which.

      - [class] FOO-RANDOM-STATE

      - [reader] STATE FOO-RANDOM-STATE

      Hey we can also print states!

      - [method] PRINT-OBJECT (OBJECT FOO-RANDOM-STATE) STREAM

      - [variable] *FOO-STATE* #<FOO-RANDOM-STATE >

          Much like *RANDOM-STATE* but uses the FOO algorithm.

      - [function] GAUSSIAN-RANDOM STDDEV &KEY RANDOM-STATE

          Return a random number from a zero mean normal distribution with
          STDDEV.

      - [function] UNIFORM-RANDOM LIMIT &KEY RANDOM-STATE

          Return a random number from the [0, LIMIT) uniform distribution.

      ## Examples

  More fancy markdown or html output with automatic markup and linking
  of uppercase symbol names found in docstrings, section numbering,
  table of contents, etc is possible by calling the DOCUMENT function.

  *One can even generate documentation for different, but related
  libraries at the same time with the output going to different files,
  but with cross-page links being automatically added for symbols
  mentioned in docstrings.* For a complete example of how to generate
  HTML with multiple pages, see `src/doc.lisp`.

  Note how `(VARIABLE *FOO-STATE*)` in the DEFSECTION form both
  exports `*FOO-STATE*` and includes its documentation in
  `@FOO-RANDOM-MANUAL`. The symbols VARIABLE and FUNCTION are just two
  instances of 'locatives' which are used in DEFSECTION to refer to
  definitions tied to symbols. See @PAX-LOCATIVE-TYPES.")

(defsection @pax-emacs-integration (:title "Emacs Integration")
  "Integration into SLIME's M-. (`slime-edit-definition`) allows one
  to visit the source location of the thing that's identified by a
  symbol and the locative before or after the symbol in a buffer. With
  this extension, if a locative is the previous or the next expression
  around the symbol of interest, then M-. will go straight to the
  definition which corresponds to the locative. If that fails, M-.
  will try to find the definitions in the normal way which may involve
  popping up an xref buffer and letting the user interactively select
  one of possible definitions.

  *Note that the this feature is implemented in terms of
  SWANK-BACKEND:FIND-SOURCE-LOCATION and
  SWANK-BACKEND:FIND-DEFINITIONS whose support varies across the Lisp
  implementations.*

  In the following examples, pressing M-. when the cursor is on one of
  the characters of `FOO` or just after `FOO`, will visit the
  definition of function `FOO`:

      function foo
      foo function
      (function foo)
      (foo function)

  In particular, references in a DEFSECTION form are in (SYMBOL
  LOCATIVE) format so M-. will work just fine there.

  Just like vanilla M-., this works in comments and docstrings. In
  this example pressing M-. on `FOO` will visit `FOO`'s default
  method:

  ```commonlisp
  ;;;; See FOO `(method () (t t t))` for how this all works.
  ;;;; But if the locative has semicolons inside: FOO `(method
  ;;;; () (t t t))`, then it won't, so be wary of line breaks
  ;;;; in comments.
  ```

  With a prefix argument (`C-u M-.`), one can enter a symbol plus a
  locative separated by whitespace to preselect one of the
  possibilities.

  The M-. extensions can be enabled by done adding this to your Emacs
  initialization file:

  ```elisp
  (defun slime-edit-locative-definition (name &optional where)
    (or (slime-locate-definition name (slime-locative-before))
