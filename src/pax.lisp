  "As a user, I frequently run into documentation that's incomplete
  and out of date, so I tend to stay in the editor and explore the
  code by jumping around with SLIME's [`M-.`][SLIME-M-.]. As a library
  author, I spend a great deal of time polishing code, but precious
  little writing documentation.

  [SLIME-M-.]: http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Finding-definitions.html#Finding-definitions

  In fact, I rarely write anything more comprehensive than docstrings
  for exported stuff. Writing docstrings feels easier than writing a
  separate user manual and they are always close at hand during
  development. The drawback of this style is that users of the library
  have to piece the big picture together themselves.

  That's easy to solve, I thought, let's just put all the narrative
  that holds docstrings together in the code and be a bit like a
  Literate Programming weenie turned inside out. The original
  prototype which did almost everything I wanted was this:

  ```
  (defmacro defsection (name docstring)
    `(defun ,name () ,docstring))
  ```

  Armed with DEFSECTION, I soon found myself organizing code following
  the flow of user level documentation and relegated comments to
  implementational details entirely. However, some portions of
  DEFSECTION docstrings were just listings of all the functions,
  macros and variables related to the narrative, and this list was
  effectively repeated in the DEFPACKAGE form complete with little
  comments that were like section names. A clear violation of
  [OAOO][oaoo], one of them had to go, so DEFSECTION got a list of
  symbols to export.

  [oaoo]: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OnceAndOnlyOnce

  That was great, but soon I found that the listing of symbols is
  ambiguous if, for example, a function, a compiler macro and a class
  are named by the same symbol. This did not concern exporting, of
  course, but it didn't help readability. Distractingly, on such
  symbols, `M-.` was popping up selection dialogs. There were two
  birds to kill, and the symbol got accompanied by a type which was
  later generalized into the concept of locatives:

  ```commonlisp
  (defsection @mgl-pax-introduction ()
    \"A single line for one man ...\"
    (foo class)
    (bar function))
  ```

  After a bit of elisp hacking, `M-.` was smart enough to disambiguate
  based on the locative found in the vicinity of the symbol and
  everything was good for a while.

  Then I realized that sections could refer to other sections if there
  were a SECTION locative. Going down that path, I soon began to feel
  the urge to generate pretty documentation as all the necessary
  information was manifest in the DEFSECTION forms. The design
  constraint imposed on documentation generation was that following
  the typical style of upcasing symbols in docstrings there should be
  no need to explicitly mark up links: if `M-.` works, then the
  documentation generator shall also be able find out what's being
  referred to.

  I settled on [Markdown][markdown] as a reasonably non-intrusive
  format, and a few thousand lines later PAX was born.

  [markdown]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/")

(defsection @mgl-pax-tutorial (:title "Tutorial")
  """PAX provides an extremely poor man's Explorable Programming
  environment. Narrative primarily lives in so called sections that
  mix markdown docstrings with references to functions, variables,
  etc, all of which should probably have their own docstrings.

  The primary focus is on making code easily explorable by using
  SLIME's `M-.` (`slime-edit-definition`). See how to enable some
  fanciness in @MGL-PAX-EMACS-INTEGRATION. Generating documentation
  from sections and all the referenced items in Markdown or HTML
  format is also implemented.

  With the simplistic tools provided, one may accomplish similar
  effects as with Literate Programming, but documentation is generated
  from code, not vice versa and there is no support for chunking yet.
  Code is first, code must look pretty, documentation is code.

  In typical use, PAX packages have no :EXPORT's defined. Instead the
  DEFINE-PACKAGE form gets a docstring which may mention section
  names (defined with DEFSECTION). When the code is loaded into the
  lisp, pressing `M-.` in SLIME on the name of the section will take
  you there. Sections can also refer to other sections, packages,
  functions, etc and you can keep exploring.

  Here is an example of how it all works together:

  ```commonlisp
  (mgl-pax:define-package :foo-random
    (:documentation "This package provides various utilities for
    random. See FOO-RANDOM:@FOO-RANDOM-MANUAL.")
    (:use #:common-lisp #:mgl-pax))

  (in-package :foo-random)

  (defsection @foo-random-manual (:title "Foo Random manual")
    "Here you describe what's common to all the referenced (and
    exported) functions that follow. They work with *FOO-STATE*,
    and have a :RANDOM-STATE keyword arg. Also explain when to
    choose which."
    (foo-random-state class)
    (state (reader foo-random-state))
    "Hey we can also print states!"
    (print-object (method () (foo-random-state t)))
    (*foo-state* variable)
    (gaussian-random function)
    (uniform-random function)
    ;; this is a subsection
    (@foo-random-examples section))

  (defclass foo-random-state ()
    ((state :reader state)))

  (defmethod print-object ((object foo-random-state) stream)
    (print-unreadable-object (object stream :type t)))

  (defvar *foo-state* (make-instance 'foo-random-state)
    "Much like *RANDOM-STATE* but uses the FOO algorithm.")

  (defun uniform-random (limit &key (random-state *foo-state*))
    "Return a random number from the between 0 and LIMIT (exclusive)
    uniform distribution."
    nil)

  (defun gaussian-random (stddev &key (random-state *foo-state*))
    "Return a random number from a zero mean normal distribution with
    STDDEV."
    nil)

  (defsection @foo-random-examples (:title "Examples")
    "Let's see the transcript of a real session of someone working
    with FOO:

    ```cl-transcript
    (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO
    => :HELLO
    => (1 2)

    (make-instance 'foo-random-state)
    ==> #<FOO-RANDOM-STATE >
    ```")
  ```

  Generating documentation in a very stripped down markdown format is
  easy:

  ```commonlisp
  (describe @foo-random-manual)
  ```

  For this example, the generated markdown would look like this:

      # Foo Random manual

      ###### \[in package FOO-RANDOM\]
      Here you describe what's common to all the referenced (and
      exported) functions that follow. They work with *FOO-STATE*,
      and have a :RANDOM-STATE keyword arg. Also explain when to
      choose which.

      - [class] FOO-RANDOM-STATE

      - [reader] STATE FOO-RANDOM-STATE

      Hey we can also print states!

      - [method] PRINT-OBJECT (OBJECT FOO-RANDOM-STATE) STREAM

      - [variable] *FOO-STATE* #<FOO-RANDOM-STATE >

          Much like *RANDOM-STATE* but uses the FOO algorithm.

      - [function] GAUSSIAN-RANDOM STDDEV &KEY (RANDOM-STATE *FOO-STATE*)

          Return a random number from a zero mean normal distribution with
          STDDEV.

      - [function] UNIFORM-RANDOM LIMIT &KEY (RANDOM-STATE *FOO-STATE*)

          Return a random number from the between 0 and LIMIT (exclusive)
          uniform distribution.

      ## Examples

      Let's see the transcript of a real session of someone working
      with FOO:

      ```cl-transcript
      (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
      .. HELLO
      => :HELLO
      => (1 2)

      (make-instance 'foo-random-state)
      ==> #<FOO-RANDOM-STATE >

      ```

  More fancy markdown or HTML output with automatic markup and linking
  of uppercase symbol names found in docstrings, section numbering,
  table of contents, etc is possible by calling the DOCUMENT function.

  *One can even generate documentation for different, but related
  libraries at the same time with the output going to different files,
  but with cross-page links being automatically added for symbols
  mentioned in docstrings. See @MGL-PAX-GENERATING-DOCUMENTATION for
  some convenience functions to cover the most common cases.*

  Note how `(VARIABLE *FOO-STATE*)` in the DEFSECTION form both
  exports `*FOO-STATE*` and includes its documentation in
  `@FOO-RANDOM-MANUAL`. The symbols VARIABLE and FUNCTION are just two
  instances of 'locatives' which are used in DEFSECTION to refer to
  definitions tied to symbols. See @MGL-PAX-LOCATIVE-TYPES.

  The transcript in the code block tagged with `cl-transcript` is
  automatically checked for up-to-dateness. See
  @MGL-PAX-TRANSCRIPT.""")

(defsection @mgl-pax-emacs-integration (:title "Emacs Integration")
  "Integration into SLIME's `M-.` (`slime-edit-definition`) allows one
  to visit the source location of the thing that's identified by a
  symbol and the locative before or after the symbol in a buffer. With
  this extension, if a locative is the previous or the next expression
  around the symbol of interest, then `M-.` will go straight to the
  definition which corresponds to the locative. If that fails, `M-.`
  will try to find the definitions in the normal way which may involve
  popping up an xref buffer and letting the user interactively select
  one of possible definitions.

  *Note that the this feature is implemented in terms of
  SWANK-BACKEND:FIND-SOURCE-LOCATION and
  SWANK-BACKEND:FIND-DEFINITIONS whose support varies across the Lisp
  implementations.*

  In the following examples, pressing `M-.` when the cursor is on one
  of the characters of `FOO` or just after `FOO`, will visit the
  definition of function `FOO`:

      function foo
      foo function
      (function foo)
      (foo function)

  In particular, references in a DEFSECTION form are in (SYMBOL
  LOCATIVE) format so `M-.` will work just fine there.

  Just like vanilla `M-.`, this works in comments and docstrings. In
  this example pressing `M-.` on `FOO` will visit `FOO`'s default
  method:

  ```commonlisp
  ;;;; See FOO `(method () (t t t))` for how this all works.
  ;;;; But if the locative has semicolons inside: FOO `(method
  ;;;; () (t t t))`, then it won't, so be wary of line breaks
  ;;;; in comments.
  ```

  With a prefix argument (`C-u M-.`), one can enter a symbol plus a
  locative separated by whitespace to preselect one of the
  possibilities.

  The `M-.` extensions can be enabled by adding this to your Emacs
  initialization file (or loading `src/pax.el`):"
  (pax.el (include #.(asdf:system-relative-pathname :mgl-pax "src/pax.el")
                   :header-nl "```elisp" :footer-nl "```")))

  """Write OBJECT in FORMAT to STREAM diverting some output to PAGES.
  FORMAT can be anything [3BMD][3bmd] supports which is
  currently :MARKDOWN, :HTML and :PLAIN. STREAM may be a stream
  object, T or NIL as with CL:FORMAT.

  Most often, this function is called on section objects
  like `(DOCUMENT @MGL-PAX-MANUAL)`, but it supports all kinds of
  objects for which DOCUMENT-OBJECT is defined. To look up the
  documentation of function DOCUMENT:

      (document #'document)

  To generate the documentation for separate libraries with automatic
  cross-links:

      (document (list @cube-manual @mat-manual))

  Note that not only first class objects can have documentation. For
  instance, variables and deftypes are not represented by objects.
  That's why CL:DOCUMENTATION has a DOC-TYPE argument. DOCUMENT does
  not have anything like that, instead it relies on REFERENCE objects
  to carry the extra information. We are going to see later how
  references and locatives work. Until then, here is an example on how
  to look up the documentation of type `FOO`:

      (document (locate 'foo 'type))

  One can call DESCRIBE on [SECTION][class] objects to get
  documentation in markdown format with less markup than the default.
  See DESCRIBE-OBJECT `(METHOD () (SECTION T))`.

  There are quite a few special variables that affect how output is
  generated, see @MGL-PAX-DOCUMENTATION-PRINTER-VARIABLES.

  The rest of this description deals with how to generate multiple
  pages.

  The PAGES argument is to create multi-page documents by routing some
  of the generated output to files, strings or streams. PAGES is a
  list of page specification elements. A page spec is a plist with
  keys :OBJECTS, :OUTPUT, :URI-FRAGMENT, :SOURCE-URI-FN, :HEADER-FN
  and :FOOTER-FN. OBJECTS is a list of objects (references are allowed
  but not required) whose documentation is to be sent to `OUTPUT`.

  When documentation for an object is generated, the first matching
  page spec is used, where the object matches the page spec if it is
  contained in one of its :OBJECTS in the sense of
  COLLECT-REACHABLE-OBJECTS.

  `OUTPUT` can be a number things:

  - If it's a list whose first element is a string or a pathname, then
    output will be sent to the file denoted by that and the rest of
    the elements of the list are passed on as arguments to CL:OPEN.
    One extra keyword argument is :ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST. If it's
    true, ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST will be called on the pathname
    before it's opened.

  - If it's NIL, then output will be collected in a string.

  - If it's T, then output will be sent to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.

  - If it's a stream, then output will be sent to that stream.

  If some pages are specified, DOCUMENT returns a list of designators
  for generated output. If a page whose `OUTPUT` refers to a file that
  was created (which doesn't happen if nothing would be written to
  it), then the corresponding pathname is included in the list. For
  strings the string itself, while for streams the stream object is
  included in the list. This way it's possible to write some pages to
  files and some to strings and have the return value indicate what
  was created. The output designators in the returned list are ordered
  by creation time.

  If no PAGES are specified, DOCUMENT returns a single pathname,
  string or stream object according to the value of the STREAM
  argument.

  Note that even if PAGES is specified, STREAM acts as a catch all
  taking the generated documentation for references not claimed by any
  pages. Also, the filename, string or stream corresponding to STREAM
  is always the first element in list of generated things that is the
  return value.

  HEADER-FN, if not NIL, is a function of a single stream argument
  which is called just before the first write to the page.
  Since :FORMAT :HTML only generates HTML fragments, this makes it
  possible to print arbitrary headers, typically setting the title,
  css stylesheet, or charset.

  FOOTER-FN is similar to HEADER-FN, but it's called after the last
  write to the page. For HTML, it typically just closes the body.

  URI-FRAGMENT is a string such as `"doc/manual.html"` that specifies
  where the page will be deployed on a webserver. It defines how links
  between pages will look. If it's not specified and `OUTPUT` refers
  to a file, then it defaults to the name of the file. If URI-FRAGMENT
  is NIL, then no links will be made to or from that page.

  Finally, SOURCE-URI-FN is a function of a single, REFERENCE
  argument. If it returns a value other than NIL, then it must be a
  string representing an URI. If FORMAT is :HTML and
  *DOCUMENT-MARK-UP-SIGNATURES* is true, then the locative as
  displayed in the signature will be a link to this uri. See
  MAKE-GITHUB-SOURCE-URI-FN.

  PAGES may look something like this:

  ```commonlisp
  `((;; The section about SECTIONs and everything below it ...
     :objects (, @mgl-pax-sections)
     ;; ... is so boring that it's not worth the disk space, so
     ;; send it to a string.
     :output (nil)
     ;; Explicitly tell other pages not to link to these guys.
     :uri-fragment nil)
    ;; Send the @MGL-PAX-EXTENSION-API section and everything reachable
    ;; from it ...
    (:objects (, @mgl-pax-extension-api)
     ;; ... to build/tmp/pax-extension-api.html.
     :output ("build/tmp/pax-extension-api.html")
     ;; However, on the web server html files will be at this
     ;; location relative to some common root, so override the
     ;; default:
     :uri-fragment "doc/dev/pax-extension-api.html"
     ;; Set html page title, stylesheet, charset.
     :header-fn 'write-html-header
     ;; Just close the body.
     :footer-fn 'write-html-footer)
    ;; Catch the reference that were not reachable from the above. It
    ;; is important for this page spec to be last.
    (:objects (, @mgl-pax-manual)
     :output ("build/tmp/manual.html")
     ;; Links from the extension api page to the manual page will
     ;; be to ../user/pax-manual#<anchor>, while links going to

     :uri-fragment "doc/user/pax-manual.html"

  Now, if `BAR` has references with different locatives:

  ```commonlisp
  (defsection @foo
    (foo function)
    (bar function)
    (bar type))

  (defun foo (x)
    "Calls `BAR` on `X`."
    (bar x))
  ```

  then documentation would link to all interpretations:

      - [function] FOO X

          Calls `BAR`([`1`][link-id-1] [`2`][link-id-2]) on `X`.

  This situation occurs in PAX with SECTION which is both a class (see
  [SECTION][class]) and a locative type denoted by a symbol (see
  [SECTION][locative]). Back in the example above, clearly,
  there is no reason to link to type `BAR`, so one may wish to select
  the function locative. There are two ways to do that. One is to
  specify the locative explicitly as the id of a reference link:

      "Calls [BAR][function] on X."

  However, if in the text there is a locative immediately before or
  after the symbol, then that locative is used to narrow down the
  range of possibilities. This is similar to what the `M-.` extension
  does. In a nutshell, if `M-.` works without questions then the
  documentation will contain a single link. So this also works without
  any markup:

      "Calls function `BAR` on X."

  This last option needs backticks around the locative if it's not a
  single symbol.

  Note that [*DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*][variable] can be combined with
  [`*DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE*`][] to have links generated for
  uppercase names with no quoting required.""")

  "When true, HTML anchors are generated before the heading of

(defparameter *document-min-link-hash-length* 4

  documentation which can be a pain in a version control system.

  Clearly, there is a tradeoff here. This variable controls how many
  characters of the md5 sum of the full link id (the reference as a
  string) are retained. If collisions are found due to the low number
  of characters, then the length of the hash of the colliding
  reference is increased.

  it can make markdown output more readable.")

  include non-lisp files in the documentation (say markdown or elisp
  as in the next example) or regions of lisp source files. This can
  reduce clutter and duplication.

  ```commonlisp
  (defsection example-section ()
    (pax.el (include #.(asdf:system-relative-pathname :mgl-pax "src/pax.el")
                     :header-nl "```elisp" :footer-nl "```"))

  ;;; documentation since we use the dummy END-OF-FOO-EXAMPLE
  ;;; variable to mark the end location.
  (defvar end-of-foo-example)

  ;;; More irrelevant code follows.
  ```

  In the above example, pressing `M-.` on PAX.EL will open the
  `src/pax.el` file and put the cursor on its first character. `M-.`
  on `FOO-EXAMPLE` will go to the source location of the `(asdf:system
  locative)` locative.

  When documentation is generated, the entire `pax.el` file is
  included in the markdown surrounded by the strings given as
  HEADER-NL and FOOTER-NL (if any). The trailing newline character is
  assumed implicitly. If that's undesirable, then use HEADER and
  FOOTER instead. The documentation of `FOO-EXAMPLE` will be the
  region of the file from the source location of the START
  locative (inclusive) to the source location of the END
  locative (exclusive). START and END default to the beginning and end
  of the file, respectively.

  Note that the file of the source location of :START and :END must be
  the same. If SOURCE is pathname designator, then it must be absolute
  so that the locative is context independent.

  Finally, if specified LINE-PREFIX is a string that's prepended to
  each line included in the documentation. For example, a string of
  four spaces makes markdown think it's a code block.""")
